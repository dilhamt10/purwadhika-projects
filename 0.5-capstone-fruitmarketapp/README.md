# 🚀 Fruit Market | Python Project
## 0.5 – Pre-Capstone CRUD App 
This is a practice capstone project built with Python in Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook) to sharpen my skills before tackling the official Module 1 Capstone at the Purwadhika Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp.

### It features a structured dataframe containing:
- 🍎 **Fruit Name**
- 📦 **Stock (per kg)**
- 💰 **Price (Rp per kg)**

### Core Features:
- ➕ **Add** new stock - CREATE
- ✅ **Display** current fruit stock - READ
- 🛒 **Buy fruit** by selecting type & quantity, showing total cost - UPDATE
- ❌ **Delete** fruit from the list - DELETE
- 💸 **Payment system** – Handles excess, exact, or insufficient payment with proper messages
- 🧾 **Receipt generation** with grand total, payment amount, change or shortage, and a thank-you note
- 📊 **Stock updates** after every transaction

This mini-project is part of my learning journey to build **data-driven applications with dummy use cases** and improve **Python logic and data handling.**
